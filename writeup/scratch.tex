\subsection{Old stuff}
We reproduced the figure 4, 5, 6 of \cite{stiliadis} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4-stil}, ~\ref{fig:5-stil} and ~\ref{fig:6-stil}. All of the figures closely followed the figures described in ~\cite{stiliadis}. Because the paper did not mention how many packets they sent for the experiment, we set it to send 20,000 packets in total. 

One point to mention is that for Figure ~\ref{fig:5-stil}, on high load factor, the delay of WPIM is off by a factor of 2 compared to the result in ~\cite{stiliadis}. This may be because the paper used the different number of packets for its experiment. Since the delay keeps increasing in a high load, the number of packets we test have a huge impact on the total average packet delay. Nevertheless, our reproduced result followed the similar trend.
