abstract = "Motivated by the need for a simple and high performance switch architecture that scales up with the speed of fiber optics, we propose a switch architecture with two-stage switching fabrics and one-stage buffering. The first stage performs load balancing, while the second stage is a Birkhoff–von Neumann input-buffered switch that performs switching for load balanced traffic. Such a switch is called the load balanced Birkhoff–von Neumann switch in this paper. The on-line complexity of the switch is O(1). It is shown that under a mild technical condition on the input traffic, the load balanced Birkhoff–von Neumann switch achieves 100% throughput as an output-buffered switch for both unicast and multicast traffic with fan-out splitting. When input traffic is bursty, we show that load balancing is very effective in reducing delay, and the average delay of the load balanced Birkhoff–von Neumann switch is proven to converge to that of an output-buffered switch under heavy load. Also, by simulations, we demonstrate that load balancing is more effective than the conflict resolution algorithm, i-SLIP, in heavy load. When both the load balanced Birkhoff–von Neumann switch and the corresponding output-buffered switch are allocated with the same finite amount of buffer at each port, we also show that the packet loss probability in the load balanced Birkhoff–von Neumann switch is much smaller than that in an output-buffered switch, when the buffer is large."

abstract = "Multicast enables efficient data transmission from one source to multiple destinations, and has been playing an important role in Internet multimedia applications. Although several multicast scheduling schemes for packet switches have been proposed in the literature, they usually aim to achieve only short multicast latency and high throughput without considering bandwidth guarantees. However, fair bandwidth allocation is critical for the quality of service (QoS) of the network, and is necessary to support multicast applications requiring guaranteed performance services, such as online audio and video streaming. This paper addresses the issue of bandwidth guaranteed multicast scheduling on virtual output queued (VOQ) switches. We propose the Credit based Multicast Fair scheduling (CMF) algorithm, which aims at achieving not only short multicast latency but also fair bandwidth allocation. CMF uses a credit based strategy to guarantee the reserved bandwidth of an input port on each output port of the switch. It keeps track of the difference between the reserved bandwidth and actually received bandwidth, and minimizes the difference to ensure fairness. Moreover, in order to fully utilize the multicast capability provided by the switch, CMF lets a multicast packet simultaneously send transmission requests to multiple output ports. In this way, a multicast packet has more chances to be delivered to multiple destination output ports in the same time slot and thus to achieve short multicast latency. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of CMF, and the results demonstrate that CMF achieves the two design goals: fair bandwidth allocation and short multicast latency."
